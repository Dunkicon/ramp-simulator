# Ramp Simulator

An interface for _simulating_ specific sequences of spells, the aim is to provide an easy way to consider various
complex spell combinations that are otherwise very arduous to plot and calculate. With the Ramp Simulator you can
consider the same sequence of spells with different legendaries, covenants, statistics, or with minor variations in
priority.

## Installation

- Clone the repository
- Run `yarn` to install dependencies
- Run `yarn start` to start the interface

## Running Tests

Currently the library doesn't have a huge amount of coverage, however if you wish to run the test suit it's as easy as
running `yarn run test`.
